4th Year Thesis - Examining Different Procedural Generation Methods and Algorithms used in Game Development

Research and development based project in which I examined some of the different methods and algorithms used in the creation of
procedurally generated content. The aim of this project was to create a small procedurally generated game. The game was created in the
Unreal Engine and coded with C++ and Blueprints Visual Scripting. The game that was created involved a number of levels that each
contained a procedurally generated maze that the player can traverse.
